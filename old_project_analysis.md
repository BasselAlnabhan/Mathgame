# Math Monster Game - Project Analysis

## Project Overview

This is a canvas-based math learning game where monsters descend from the top of the screen carrying math problems that players must solve by typing the correct answers.

## Key Features

- Canvas-based rendering with sprite animations
- Progressive difficulty (speed increases over time)
- Multiple monster types with different animations
- Different types of math problems (addition, multiplication, subtraction)
- Configurable difficulty via XML configuration
- Sound effects and background music
- Score tracking

## Current Project Structure

- All game logic embedded in index.html
- Supporting JavaScript files:
  - monster.js: Handles monster entities
  - sprite.js: Manages sprite animations
  - resources.js: Loads and manages game resources
  - util.js: Utility functions
  - rules.js: Game rules and difficulty progression
  - explosion.js: Explosion animation when monsters are defeated

## Game Flow

1. Player starts the game by pressing any key
2. Monsters descend from top of screen with math problems
3. Player types answers to destroy monsters
4. If monsters reach the bottom line, game over
5. Speed and number of monsters increase over time

## Areas for Improvement

1. Reorganize project structure (separate HTML, CSS, JS)
2. Implement modern JS practices and modularization
3. Add responsive design for different screen sizes
4. Improve audio handling for better browser compatibility
5. Add testing infrastructure
6. Consider converting to a modern framework
